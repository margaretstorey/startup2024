# Presenting Your Ideas
In our third meeting (**26/01/2024**) you should present your project idea -- we recognize this is a work in progress!

Each team presentation will have **12 minutes** as follows (strict time limit):

- In the first 4 minutes you will present the main scenario (**use-case**) and users (**target audience**) that your application targets.
    - Describe the situation, the need (**the problem**), the data you will need to build your app, and the decisions made in the process.
    - Describe the overall architecture of the application (high level). What functionality will be implemented in each part? (client/server/mobile/external sources/etc.)
    - Estimate what can be **demonstrated** in Milestone 1 (which features will you aim to have), and what can be demonstrated in Milestones 2 and 3 (of course this is likely to evolve). Estimate possible extensions that perhaps could not be finished within the time frame of the semester, but seem to be natural extensions of your application.
    - If possible, include a few **UI mockups** in your presentation (obviously very early ideas - we will show you some UI mockup tools in the following week).
- In the next 8 minutes you will answer questions from the mentors.  Students can and are encouraged to provide feedback using Slack. During this discussion, the course mentors will estimate whether your use-case is well developed and your estimations are realistic.
- The feedback from mentors will be summarized and sent to you after the class. 

**Some Tips:**

- Early feedback is a good thing! It is advisable that you send us your idea as soon as possible via email ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)) - this can save you a lot of time (e.g. if you took a wrong direction, impossible mission, etc.).
- 12 minutes is a very short time for your presentation and feedback! You have 4 minutes for your presentation - rehearse your timing.
- If you plan to use slides for your presentation (PowerPoint or Google Slides), avoid adding too much text/content per slide. 
- Be visual: if you have already thought about the user interface, you may show a sketch of it in the presentation.
- You may bring your own laptop (so no compatibility problems would occur during your presentation).
- Be simple and precise.
- Rehearse your presentation within the team and make sure you are all on the same page.
- If you have some free time, consider watching the Y Combinator Office Hours videos from a few years ago ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cWPxuxqdGQ)), also see this article from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca/guides/atlas/pitching) and check other resources to inspire you!
- Consider the 5 U's of pain when thinking about your idea [see slide 6 of this deck](https://www.slideshare.net/zephram/the-ideal-business-idea) 
 For creating UI mockups consider using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/download/), free for 30 days. Other UI prototyping tools are listed on the resources page. 

**If you haven't done so already, please send us an email with the names of your team members** ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)).

Good luck!
