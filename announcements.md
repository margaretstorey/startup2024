### Weekly Meetings
Please examine the meeting schedule dates. For the last meeting (Milestone 3) we usually try to have a social event with guests, and it **may be at a different location or scheduled for a different time of day**. So please try to block off additional time in your schedule now.  If you miss this important session, you will have to meet with the course staff later to orally present the project and your contribution.

### Intellectual Property Ownership
Students are asked to consult with the [project participant agreement](resources/Project_Participant_Agreement.pdf). UVic will agree to waive its
interest in such IP under the following conditions:

1. A class list and list of associated projects (contained with the attached [Project Participant Agreement](resources/Project_Participant_Agreement.pdf)) is provided to ORS (via RPKM) **within 1 month** of the start date of the course, and
2. That the students make their IP developed during the course **freely available** to other students taking the course for learning purpose only for the duration of the course
3. Each student participating **signs** the attached “Project Participation Agreement” (PPA) where they acknowledge they will not use any faculty IP/University owned IP in their project.

### Waitlist

The course is currently oversubscribed but we anticipate some spots will open up as this is an intense workload class and some will drop.  If you cannot commit to attending every class, working (in person most likely) with your team multiple times per week, and doing additional readings outside of class, this class may not be for you.  Every member of every team will need to take and demonstrate initiative in designing and building your apps, and work consistently throughout the term.  If you have a heavy courseload, this course may not be a good fit this term.  We may offer this course again next year (stay tuned).
