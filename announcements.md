### Weekly Meetings
Please examine the meeting schedule dates. Class meetings are **not** scheduled for every week of the semester!
Additionally, for the last meeting (Milestone 3) we usually try to have a social event with guests, and it **may be at a different location or scheduled for a different time of day**.

### Intellectual Property Ownership
Students are asked to consult with the [project participant agreement](resources/Project_Participant_Agreement.pdf). UVic will agree to waive its
interest in such IP under the following conditions:

1. A class list and list of associated projects (contained with the attached [Project Participant Agreement](resources/Project_Participant_Agreement.pdf)) is provided to ORS (via RPKM) **within 1 month** of the start date of the course, and
2. That the students make their IP developed during the course **freely available** to other students taking the course for learning purpose only for the duration of the course
3. Each student participating **signs** the attached “Project Participation Agreement” (PPA) where they acknowledge they will not use any faculty IP/University owned IP in their project.
