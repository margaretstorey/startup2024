# Milestone 3 - Final Presentation (Public Beta)

Due April 5, 2024. Note:  
  
In this meeting, you'll have the opportunity to present the beta version of your project and share your experience with each other, the mentors as well as additional guests! Each team will have **10 minutes** followed by Q&A with mentors, guests and other students.  At around 4:30pm, we will have a small informal party to celebrate your accomplishments. 

We remind you that for this third milestone you are required to provide a fully functioning project, that will be evaluated by the mentoring staff. You will get valuable feedback regarding the expected final project configuration and scope.  **By the third milestone you should have completed your product** (except for some minor bugs which you may fix until the [Final Submission](/final%20submission.md)). 

Please send us the presentation by email beforehand. As we may have additional guests that did not attend your previous presentations, **make sure your presentation is self contained**.  

Please include in your presentation (max: 10 minutes):

- **Pitch**:  Product overview and motivation (Maximum: 90 seconds).
- **Demo**: Show your product from the perspective of your personas that show the main scenarios and features (approx. 4-5 mins)
- **User feedback**: Share the insights you have gained by testing your product with real users/customers (approx. 2-3 mins)
- **Next steps**: Tell us what you plan to do before the end of term and after the course. *Note: Bonus marks if you include a description of how you will monetize your product!* (approx. 1-2 mins)

Some advice:

- Aim your **pitch** at a "new and general audience".  See below for resources on how to prepare an effective and compelling  pitch.  We may have some new guests attend. 
- Prepare an appealing **demo**! You only have a short time for the demonstration, so start with your key features and give an overview of what the app is about for guests who will be there for the first time.  If you are demonstrating social features or any other features that require prior preparations - prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users).  Do a live demo but have a video as backup on your GitHub site. 
- Please remember to keep your **documents** up to date on GitHub. 

How to "pitch" resources: 
-  You can do this without a deck or you can use a "pitch deck". Staying within time is critical. But be clear: who is your pitch aimed at? An investor, a customer? 
-  [How to build a great pitch](https://learn.marsdd.com/article/how-to-build-a-great-pitch/) 
- [How to pitch your Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17XZGUX_9iM) Note this is also aimed at investors. 
- [StartupFest pitch competition winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1M2LcL5Oo4) This also shows questions that are asked!
