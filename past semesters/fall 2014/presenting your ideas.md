# Presenting Your Ideas
In our third meeting (19/09/2014) you should present your project idea.

You will be given 15 minutes as follows:

- In the first 5 minutes you will present the main scenario (**use-case**) and users (**target audience**) that your application targets.
    - Describe the situation, the need (**the problem**), the data involved, and the decisions made in the process.
    - Describe the overall architecture of the application. What functionality will be implemented in each part? (client/server/mobile/external sources/etc.)
    - Estimate what can be **demonstrated** in Milestone 1, and what can be demonstrated in Milestones 2 and 3. Estimate possible extensions that could not be finished within the time frame of the semester, but seem to be natural extensions of your application.
    - Include **UI mockups** in your presentation.
- In the next 5 minutes you will answer questions from the rest of the class and the course staff. During this discussion, the course mentors will estimate whether your use-case is well developed and your estimations are realistic.
- In the last 5 minutes you will get feedback from the mentors.

**Some Tips:**

- Early feedback is a good thing! It is advisable that you send us your idea as soon as possible via email ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)) - this can save you a lot of time (e.g. if you took a wrong direction, impossible mission, etc.).
- 15 minutes is a very short time!
- If you are preparing a power point presentation - **do not prepare more than 5 slides** (including cover slide).
- Be visual: if you have already thought about user interface, you may show a sketch of it in the presentation.
- You may bring your own laptop (so no compatibility problems would occur during your presentation).
- Be simple and precise.
- Take a look at presentations from previous semesters. An example for a good presentation: [Moishd - 2010/2011A](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxjbG91ZHdlYjEwYXxneDoyOWIzOTg0NWQ5ZDQ3YTdh&pli=1)
- Rehearse your presentation within the team and make sure you are all on the same page.
- If you plan on using slides, please email them to us before the meeting.

**If you haven't done so already, please send us an email with the names of your team members** ([startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)).

Good luck!
