# Milestone 3 - Final Presentation (Public Beta)

We are happy to invite you to present your third milestone at ECS 660, Friday 28/11/2014 (note the room change) at 2:30pm until 5pm. We will have a social event following the class (details are forthcoming). 
  
In this meeting, you'll have the opportunity to present the beta version of your project and share your experience with each other (as well as additional guests).

We remind you that for this third milestone you are required to provide a fully functioning project, that will be evaluated by the course staff.  You will get valuable feedback regarding the expected final project configuration and scope.

This is not BETA in the sense of "only a proof of concept" but rather in the sense of "you could still fix minor bugs or add minor missing features emerged at the last minute". **By the third milestone you should have completed your product** (except for some minor bugs which you may fix until the [Final Submission](final submission.md)). Please provide a full demonstration (**15 minutes**) of using your product in various scenarios on the *live* project. The demonstration should encompass your top features, and highlight your product complexity and challenges (architectural/algorithmic/technological/design/usability etc).  You should also talk about your development process (for an additional **5 minutes**).  Tell us: how did you split the work? what was easy? what was difficult? why? what did you learn during the course? what feedback did you receive from users about your app?

If you are using a power point presentation, use **no more than 10** slides altogether (including cover slide). Please send us the presentation (and any other document that you think would be useful for us to better evaluate your work) by email beforehand. As we may have additional guests that did not attend your previous presentations, **make sure your presentation is self contained**.  You may also invite additional guests to the presentation.

Please include in your presentation:

- Product overview and motivation
- High level architecture, and the technologies used
- Project challenges, including your own experience and reflections

Some general advice:

- Prepare an appealing demo!
- You have only a short time for the demonstration so start with your key features and give an overview of what the app is about for guests who will be there for the first time.
- If you are demonstrating social features of your gadget, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- It is also advised to rehearse your presentation so it will flow nicely. For example: make sure you can demonstrate different users simultaneously using different browsers.
- Try to test out your laptop in ECS 660 in advance of your presentation.  

If by this stage you've already done a pilot with real users please provide a **very short** summary explaining how you've done the pilot and what feedback you've received from the users (please send us by email the pilot summary beforehand).

For mobile applications you are required to provide a link to a page which will include installation and usage instructions for your users. This page should have images/videos which show how to install and use your application. In addition it should have a requirements section (i.e. if your app needs android 4.0). This page needs to be simple and clear so that any user (including users which have never seen your app before) could install and use your application.

**Important note:** Full grading for the milestone (25 points) will be given for teams that successfully:

1. Focused on the primary use case and take into account our feedback from milestone 2 or earlier.
2. Followed the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously worked throughout the semester.
4. Demonstrated an interesting, self contained, useful, and live application.
5. Provided a link to a live application and a link to installation/usage instructions page
6. Implemented a set of polished features
7. Gave a good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere)

**Important note:** This is not the final submission of your project. Please see details on the [Final Submission](final submission.md) page.

If you have any questions or comments please do not wait for the milestone meeting, use email: [startup.programming@gmail.com](mailto:startup.programming@gmail.com)

Good luck,  
Peggy, Cliff, Arie, Ian and Alexey
